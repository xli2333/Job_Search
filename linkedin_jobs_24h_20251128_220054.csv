Introduction
At IBM, work is more than a job - it's a calling: To build. To design. To code. To consult. To think along with clients and sell. To make markets. To invent. To collaborate. Not just to do something better, but to attempt things you've never thought possible. Are you ready to lead in this new era of technology and solve some of the world's most challenging problems? If so, lets talk.
Your Role And Responsibilities
Are you interested in pursuing a software development career? Have you heard about agile development, but want to learn more about how it 'works'? Are you someone that has a foundational understanding of development or programming concepts, but want to take a less traditional path to achieve it?
What is an Apprenticeship?
IBM Apprenticeship Program, which lasts approximately 12 months, is an official registered apprenticeship recognized by the Department of Labor (DOL). Every graduate of a Registered Apprenticeship program receives a nationally-recognized credential from the DOL.
During the apprenticeship duration, you will be required to complete specific learning hours and on the job training that has been outlined to ensure you are developing the skills and competencies essential to the role. You will be able to learn and grow at your own pace, but we expect most apprentices will complete their learning within 12 months. Once you graduate and receive your certificate from our apprentice program, you will be eligible to apply to available full-time roles at IBM.
Who you Are

We're seeking candidates who have the following requirements, but we know you're just getting your career started, and we're committed to helping you learn and grow.

Application Development, DevOps automation, and the development toolchain (e.g. Travis, Jenkins, Junit, automated test tools) 
What's the Experience?
As an apprentice, you'll join with other apprentices in a local cohort. You'll go through your first few weeks together, learning about IBM and the skills you'll be attaining throughout your apprenticeship. Then, you'll work with your managers and mentors to progress through your personal skills roadmap, learning and demonstrating new knowledge and competencies through hands-on application with your project teams. You'll complete milestones along the way, earning digital credentials to validate your skills, and will come back together with other apprentices to participate in on-going training and development focused on your professional and technical skills.
As a Software Engineer Apprentice at IBM, you'll work as part of a larger team of experienced developers and mentors in an interactive, collaborative environment. You'll learn the fundamentals of development, software design, testing, and cloud computing, agile principles, IBM Design Thinking, DevOps and continuous delivery. You will also learn how to resolve IBM customer issues, debug customer problems and environments, and increase Cloud Service skills, and will build the skills to grow your career as a Software Developer.

"Postdoctoral Fellow, Engineering Non-Coding Genome in Immune Cells (Immunogenomics Group)",Biohub,"New York, NY",2 hours ago,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/postdoctoral-fellow-engineering-non-coding-genome-in-immune-cells-immunogenomics-group-at-biohub-4337798827,4337798827,"Biohub is leading the new era of AI-powered biology to cure or prevent disease through its 501c3 medical research organization, with the support of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
The Team
Biohub will first harness the natural capabilities of our immune cells to detect and fix abnormalities in our bodies at very early stages. It will then bioengineer immune cells to create new capabilities to detect and potentially treat events before they lead to untreatable disease.
Our Vision
We pursue large scientific challenges that cannot be pursued in conventional environments
We enable individual investigators to pursue their riskiest and most innovative ideas
The technologies developed at Biohub facilitate research by scientists and clinicians at our home institutions and beyond
Diversity of thought, ideas, and perspectives are at the heart of Biohub and enable disruptive innovation and scholarly excellence. We are committed to cultivating an organization where all colleagues feel inspired and know their work makes an important contribution.
The Opportunity
The 
Laboratory of Immunogenomics
 at 
Biohub
 studies the non-coding regulatory genome to understand and address immune dysfunction in diseases like cancer, autoimmune disorders, and aging. We focus on enhancers—non-coding, highly cell–type–specific transcriptional regulatory elements—and their role in shaping immune responses. We develop and utilize genomic technologies, including bulk and single-cell nascent RNA sequencing, genome editing, immune engineering, and CRISPR-based functional screens in patient biopsies, organoid systems, and mouse models. Through computational analysis integrating machine learning and AI, we map enhancer–gene networks and identify disease-driving elements. Our goal is to advance enhancer-guided precision genomic medicine for diseases involving immune dysfunction.
We are seeking a highly motivated 
Postdoctoral Fellow 
to lead pioneering research into the functional mapping and engineering of non-coding regulatory elements that govern immune cell gene expression. This role will focus on identifying and manipulating enhancers, silencers, and other cis-regulatory elements that control immune-modulating genes (cytokines, chemokines, checkpoint regulators) to reprogram immune responses in health and disease.
The successful candidate will integrate advanced functional genomics, single-cell multi-omics, and synthetic biology approaches to dissect immune regulatory circuits, engineer precise expression control in immune cell subsets, and apply these strategies in in vivo models and human-derived immune organoid systems. This is a unique opportunity to operate at the intersection of genomics, immunology, and bioengineering in a collaborative, multidisciplinary environment.
What You'll Do
Functional genomics & genome engineering: 
 Apply high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9 and CRISPRi/a screens, STARR-seq, and massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) to functionally map immune-cell-specific enhancers, silencers, and boundary elements.
Single-cell & spatial genomics: 
Develop and optimize protocols for scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, scCUT&Tag, spatial transcriptomics, and multimodal platforms (e.g., 10x Genomics Multiome, Visium).
Transcriptional regulation: 
Use scGRO-seq, SLAM-seq, and nascent RNA profiling to dissect transcriptional kinetics in engineered immune cells.Epigenome editing: Employ targeted histone modification and DNA methylation tools (e.g., dCas9-p300, dCas9-TET1) to modulate enhancer activity in immune contexts.
Immune Cell Engineering
 
Primary cell manipulation: Isolate, culture, and genetically reprogram primary human and murine immune cells, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and HSPCs.
Synthetic biology circuits: Design logic-gated circuits and inducible systems for spatially and temporally controlled gene expression. 
Ex vivo & organoid models: Engineer immune cells within human immune organoids, tumor–immune co-cultures, and 3D hydrogel scaffolds. 
In vivo translation: Apply engineered cells in syngeneic and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. 
Data Integration & Computational Biology
 
Analyze large-scale multi-omic datasets with established and custom pipelines (e.g., STAR, Bowtie2, Cell Ranger, Seurat, Scanpy, ArchR).
Apply machine learning and AI-based models to prioritize candidate regulatory elements for functional validation. 
Contribute to algorithm development for integrating RNA, chromatin accessibility, and protein expression data. 
Collaboration & Dissemination
 
Partner with teams in immunology, cancer biology, and systems genomics.
Publish findings in preprints and peer-reviewed journals, and present at scientific conferences. 
Support grant development, technology transfer, and mentoring of graduate students and junior researchers. 
What You'll Bring
Essential -
A PhD in Molecular Biology, Genetics, Immunology, Bioengineering, or related field.
Hands-on experience with CRISPR/Cas genome editing, perturbation screens, and enhancer assays.
Familiarity with base and prime editing, and CRISPR off-target profiling.
Expertise in immune cell biology, including isolation, culture, and functional assays for primary immune cells and/or HSPCs.
Experience with multi-omic data analysis or working closely with computational biology teams.
Proven ability to troubleshoot complex experimental workflows and work independently.
Nice to have -
Genetic payload delivery with optimized capsid biology or lipid nanoparticles.
Experience with high-dimensional immune profiling (e.g., CyTOF, spectral flow cytometry).
Track record in single-cell technology development and application.
Proficiency in R/Python for omics data analysis.
Prior work with 3D organoid systems or microfluidics for immune cell studies.
Understanding of gene regulatory network modeling and enhancer-promoter interaction mapping (Hi-C, PLAC-seq, HiChIP).
Experience in translational immunology or immuno-oncology models
Compensation
The New York, NY base pay range for a new hire in this role is $93,000.00.
